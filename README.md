**Fitbit data Analysis**
-  Data merging in **Postgresql** using ```INSERT INTO```
- Data cleaning in **Postgresql**: I changed string data type into date data type using ```TO_DATE``` function, I ensured that the data set didn't have any duplicates nor missing/null values using ```GROUP BY``` & ```HAVING```, and ```WHERE```, finally I removed useless columns through ```ALTER``` and ```DROP```
- Analysis in **Python**: I found how often fitbit users wore their fitbit and I designed some statistic to understand how they use their smart devices.
